title: Statistical Mechanics, Hopfield Network and Boltzmann Machine

subtitle: Contains links to drafts of blogs on these topics.

Last year, I started my blogging journey and wrote blogs on the Boltzmann Machine (BM), Hopfield Network (HN) and statistical mechanics, respectively. I am sharing here links to drafts of these blogs and corresponding code. These blogs are almost in their prefinal version.

Why did I start blogging? Why did I choose these topics? Why didn't I complete them? What am I now focusing on? Answers to all these questions can be found in this blog - [Setting The Tone]({% post_url 2025-10-28-setting-the-tone %}){:target="_blank"}.

Here are (Notion) links. And code for BM and HN:
- [Blog-Thermodynamics-Statistical Mechanics-Ising Model-AI](https://www.notion.so/Blog-Thermodynamics-Statistical-Mechanics-Ising-Model-AI-2bfa87ef96fd4cbfba09b493a6250cb2?pvs=21){:target="_blank"}
- [Blog - Hopfield Network](https://www.notion.so/Blog-Hopfield-Network-1202f5954fbf80ac9f06fa5929c14493?pvs=21){:target="_blank"} ([Code](https://github.com/joshi98kishan/deciphering-hopfield-network){:target="_blank"})
- [Blog - Boltzmann Machine](https://www.notion.so/Blog-Boltzmann-Machine-1202f5954fbf808ea6d8de1cfee7b30b?pvs=21){:target="_blank"} ([Code](https://github.com/joshi98kishan/boltzmann-machine){:target="_blank"})

All these blogs are a little messy. You would find the grey-coloured text redundant. I tried to make blogs self-contained. And there are complete, clean derivations of required equations for HN and BM.

Fun Fact: In [September 2024](https://github.com/joshi98kishan/deciphering-hopfield-network/blob/1475cb7d8a679f91cf78e58c8570166700383dff/README.md){:target="_blank"}, I decided to study the Hopfield Network and the Boltzmann Machine, and on [8th October, 2024](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/prize-announcement/){:target="_blank"}, the *Nobel Prize in Physics* was announced, and it was given to the creators of these two algorithms. It was unusual because HN and BM didn't extend the knowledge of physics.
